# RV32I-Pipelined-Processor

## Overview

This is a personal project to explore and understand computer architecture in-depth. The objective of this project is to create a processor based on the open-source RV32I v2.1 ISA. The basic processor will then be extended to improve its performance using techniques learned in ECE552 Computer Architecutre (taught by Prof. Mark Jeffrey, University of Toronto)

As a tangential component of this project, my own assembler will be built. This will provide the knowledge basis for the programming side of computation, making way for exploration in program compilation and hardware-software co-design in the future to further improve processor performance.

## Project Progress
